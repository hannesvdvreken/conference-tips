# PHP UK Conference 

Website: [phpconference.co.uk](http://phpconference.co.uk/)

- The day before the conference there is always a pre-conference meetup/social. If you wait long enough, some batches of speakers will drop in after their dinner.
- London in February means rainy days. But if you bring an umbrella, there is a free wardrobe service. Be kind to staff :-)
- Brits like to queue. Queue to get your badge, queue to get food, queue to get your stuff from the wardrobe, ...
- The location is called "The Brewery". There are some big rooms and several ways to access them. Take a different exit then the door you entered a room to discover all of them. Even the best explorers will get disorientated.
- There is a multi-religion prayer room 🙏 very open to all people.
- This conference is big. Up to 700 people attending. So if you want to see a session, make sure to have a seat 5 minutes before a session starts.
- Food at lunch is amazingly delicious. But if you're hungry, the Whitecross Street has a nice street market with food stands. Delicious food being made there too.
- The cheapest place to stay is the Travel Lodge. You will definitely run into people attending the conference in the lobby downstairs.
- There's chilled water (and coffee?) at all times in the sponsor area and chill area.
- Extremely useful tip I've tried myself: get your stuff from the wardrobe _before_ the closing keynote. This way you don't have to queue when everyone want their stuff at the same time after the closing keynote.

- London bars close to the venue where people might hang out after conference hours:
